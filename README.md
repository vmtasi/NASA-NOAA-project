## Overview
ExoFinder is a machine learning pipeline designed to identify and classify potential exoplanets from the NASA Kepler space telescope data. The system categorizes Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) into three distinct classes:

1. **CONFIRMED:** Validated Exoplanets.
2. **CANDIDATE:** Potential exoplanets requiring further verification.
3. **FALSE POSITIVE:** Likely eclipsing binaries or instrumental noise.

This project focuses on a domain-driven approach, prioritizing physical transit characteristics over metadata to ensure the model learns astrophysical properties rather than pipeline artifacts.

## Dataset
**Source:** [NASA Exoplanet Archive - Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) Table](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=cumulative)

### Key Features Used
To prevent data leakage, we specifically selected physical features derived from light curve analysis:
* `koi_period`: Orbital Period (days).
* `koi_duration`: Transit Duration (hours).
* `koi_depth`: Transit Depth (parts per million).
* `koi_impact`: Impact Parameter.
* `koi_steff`, `koi_slogg`, `koi_srad`: Stellar properties (Temperature, Gravity, Radius).

## Methodology

### 1. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
* **Leakage Prevention:** Removed meta-scores (e.g., `koi_score`) generated by the Kepler pipeline to ensure the model learns from physical data.
* **Missing Data Strategy:** Implemented a "Missingness as a Feature" strategy by creating binary flags for missing rows before imputing values with the median.
* **Log-Normal Transformation:** Applied `log1p` transformations to right-skewed features (`period`, `duration`, `depth`) to normalize distributions and handle astronomical outliers.
* **Scaling:** Applied Standard Scaling to normalize feature ranges for Neural Network stability.

### 2. Model Architecture
We compared three distinct modeling approaches:
1. **Logistic Regression:** A linear baseline to establish lower-bound performance.
2. **Random Forest Classifier:** An ensemble method to capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions.
3. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):** A Deep Neural Network (TensorFlow/Keras) with Dropout layers for regularization.

## Results
The dataset is imbalanced (approx. 50% False Positives). We optimized for **F1-Score** and **Precision** to ensure high confidence in Confirmed planets.

| Model | Accuracy | Macro F1-Score | Key Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logistic Regression** | 59% | 0.57 | Fails to capture complex boundaries. |
| **Random Forest** | 73% | 0.66 | Strong performance, good interpretability. |
| **MLP (Neural Net)** | **74-75%** | **0.68** | **Best Performer.** Superior precision on False Positives. |

**Final Selection:** The **MLP model** was selected for production due to its superior ability to distinguish between `CANDIDATE` and `CONFIRMED` classes.
